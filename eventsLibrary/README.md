### Problem

#### Create an 'eventing' library out of the Events class.
#### The Events class should have methods 'on', 'trigger', and 'off'.
- 'on': Register an event handler
- 'trigger': Trigger all callbacks associated with a given eventName
- 'off': Remove all event handlers associated with the given eventName
