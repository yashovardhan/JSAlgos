### Problem

#### Create a queue data structure.
#### The queue should be a class with methods 'add' and 'remove'.
#### Adding to the queue should store an element until it is removed
#### Implement a 'peek' method in this Queue class.
#### Peek should return the last element (the next one to be returned) from the queue without removing it.

### Example
```
const q = new Queue();
q.add(1);
q.remove(); // returns 1;
```
