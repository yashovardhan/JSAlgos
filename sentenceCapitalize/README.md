### Problem

#### Write a function that accepts a string.
#### The function should capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then return the capitalized string.

### Example
```
capitalize('a short sentence') --> 'A Short Sentence'
capitalize('a lazy fox') --> 'A Lazy Fox'
capitalize('look, it is working!') --> 'Look, It Is Working!'
```
